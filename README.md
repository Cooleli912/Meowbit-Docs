# Introduction
The Meowbit is a small device that has more potential than you think.
I've been writing my own OS for the device that will be public soon, and if you want to make games you can play anywhere, this is where to start.

# Where can I buy one?
There are many sources, but Amazon is the best one.

# Coding the device
The coding is simple, no extra money required. just go to https://arcade.makecode.com/ and create a new project.

# Connecting it to your computer
This is how you import files, which is how you play it.
go to https://arcade.makecode.com/ create or go to a project.
then click on the dots, here's a refrence of what they look like:

click the choose hardware button, choose the meowbit.
In your meowbit package, there should have been a cable, plug the big side into your computer, and the little side into the small port in your meowbit device.
if your meowbit has nothing on it, then this part is easy, if a small white window pops up on your computer, choose to open file explorer, then it will open a flash drive, mine is called ARCADE-F4, you might have a different one, but it's okay, then go back over to https://arcade.makecode.com/ and go back to your project click the three dots again, then click the connect button, then choose your device, and then click the big orange download button, this will download a .uf2 file, as well as flash the uf2 file to your device.

# How do I get the battery in?
just get the thing into the white port under the weird bar thing, remember that it's on the back of the device.
Then put the battery into the weird bar thing.

# Coding with MakeCode Arcade
MakeCode Arcade supports 3 different languages, a scratch language called __Blocks__ as well as __Python__ and also __Javascript.__

# Blocks
Blocks is a simple language, and it runs perfectly on the system. I will make some docs for the Blocks language soon enough.

# Other Languages
The other 2 languages work just as they normally would. but Blocks is the best one to use.

# System Bugs
For some reason pressing the restart button makes the system lag so bad that a big program would reach 0 FPS about every 20-30 seconds.
The system can freeze randomly but is very rare.

# System Errors
I was confused at first when I saw my first system error, and just about the only one, The 21 Frowny Face.
This bug is a nightmare because you have to go through HOURS of debugging and optimizing just to fix this error! it occurs when the RAM is full.
The 21 Frowny Face is truly a Meowbit developer's worst nightmare.

# Extra Controls
The Meowbit has more controls than those little buttons, yeah, it has a motion sensor! also a light sensor, and some other weird things, but they really managed to cram so much content on to this little board with a screen.
You can use these controls with an extension called controller.

# Extensions
Yep, you heard it, extensions! Just click on the extensions button and WOAH is that a GUI for getting extensions!?
just click on one and boom, you have an extension, I will cover documentation for every useful extension I can find, that will come soon.

# Other Docs
Sadly there arent anymore docs just yet :(
