# Introduction
The Meowbit is a small device that has more potential than you think.
I've been writing my own OS for the device that will be public soon, and if you want to make games you can play anywhere, this is where to start.

# Where can I buy one?
There are many sources, but Amazon is the best one.

# Coding the device
The coding is simple, no extra money required. just go to https://arcade.makecode.com/ and create a new project.

# Connecting it to your computer
This is how you import files, which is how you play it.
go to https://arcade.makecode.com/ create or go to a project.
then click on the dots, here's a refrence of what they look like:

click the choose hardware button, choose the meowbit.
In your meowbit package, there should have been a cable, plug the big side into your computer, and the little side into the small port in your meowbit device.
if your meowbit has nothing on it, then this part is easy, if a small white window pops up on your computer, choose to open file explorer, then it will open a flash drive, mine is called ARCADE-F4, you might have a different one, but it's okay, then go back over to https://arcade.makecode.com/ and go back to your project click the three dots again, then click the connect button, then choose your device, and then click the big orange download button, this will download a .uf2 file, as well as flash the uf2 file to your device.

# How do I get the battery in?
just get the thing into the white port under the weird bar thing, remember that it's on the back of the device.
Then put the battery into the weird bar thing.

# Coding with MakeCode Arcade
